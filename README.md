# Bachelor-Thesis-on-XAI-Repository
This is the repository containing datasets and Jupyter Notebooks that support my Bachelor Thesis.
It contains three Jupyter Notebooks each describing a machine learning process in detail, analysing the provided sets of data and containing the bonus images.
The notebook "Machine Learning on Pokemon Dataset" is the one used in my bachelor thesis, while the other two are just used to gain an overview and additional insights.

Please download all files from this repository and add them to the same folder to ensure the notebooks work as intended. The notebooks can also be read by simply clicking on them in the repository, but some output cells require them to be run to show properly.

If you are not familiar with Jupyter Notebooks and how to open them, I refer to this page: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
